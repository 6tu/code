	<p><b>As of version 2.2.1, CGIProxy now uses an installation wizard, so
	this page has been completely rewritten.  Please
	<a href="mailto:james@jmarshall.com?subject=CGIProxy+installation">tell me</a>
	about any installation problems you have on any platform, so I can fix them!

	<p>Starting in version 2.2.3, there is a simple way to
	<a href="#upgrade">upgrade CGIProxy in place, with the "upgrade" command</a>.</b>

	<p>You need to install CGIProxy on a machine that's outside of any censoring
	firewall, but that is still accessible to people behind the firewall.
	You do NOT need to install anything on the browsing machine(s).  Once CGIProxy
	is installed on a machine, any number of people can use it, if they know
	its URL.

	<a name="prereq" />
	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

	<p>Now's a great time to review <a href="security.html">security when using CGIProxy</a>.

	<p>CGIProxy requires <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> and
	<a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>, but those are already installed
	on almost all Unix servers.  If you're using a Windows server, install
	both of these.

	<p>There are four ways CGIProxy can run:  as a CGI script, as a mod_perl script,
	as a FastCGI script, or with its own embedded server.  As a CGI script is the
	slowest to run, and as a mod_perl or FastCGI script are the fastest to run.
	Depending on which of these ways you choose, your Web server needs to be
	configured to support it, as detailed in the following sections.

	<p><b>If you're installing on a CentOS server:</b> CentOS doesn't
	include all standard Perl modules by default, so install those first by
	running "<code>yum install epel-release</code>" as root.  You can't even
	run the installation wizard without first doing this.

	<p><b>If you're installing on a Windows server:</b> The commands below
	that run <code>nph-proxy.cgi</code> are for Unix, but are almost the
	same for the Windows command line.  In Windows, make two changes:  start
	a command with "<code>perl</code>", and replace "<code>/</code>" with
	"<code>\</code>".  You can also remove an initial "<code>./</code>".  For example,
	instead of running "<code>./nph-proxy.cgi command</code>", run
	"<code>perl nph-proxy.cgi command</code>".


	<a name="cgi" />
	<h3>As a CGI script</h3>

	<p>Your Web server has to be configured to support CGI scripts such
	that any executable file ending in "<code>.cgi</code>" is treated as a
	CGI script.  Your webmaster normally does this.  For Apache,
	you need something like this in the section of <code>httpd.conf</code>
	that controls the directory where <code>nph-proxy.cgi</code> will be (normally
	a &lt;Directory&gt; or &lt;Files&gt; block):
<blockquote><pre>
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    Options +ExecCGI
<pre></blockquote>
	<p>Apache has a
	<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/cgi.html">page with
	all the details</a>.
	

	<a name="mod_perl" />
	<h3>As a mod_perl script</h3>

	<p>mod_perl is an optional feature of Apache servers.  With mod_perl,
	CGIProxy can run much faster than as a CGI script.  Your webmaster
	normally configures mod_perl.  If you're configuring your own mod_perl,
	you can use this block in your <code>httpd.conf</code> to make all scripts
	ending in "<code>.pl</code>" use mod_perl:
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;Files *.pl&gt;
    Options +ExecCGI
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
    PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
    PerlSendHeader Off
    &lt;Files nph-*&gt;
        PerlOptions -ParseHeaders
    &lt;/Files&gt;
&lt;/Files&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

	<p>If you know how to configure Apache, you can tweak this as desired.
	If you use the block above, then rename
	<code>nph-proxy.cgi</code> to <code>nph-proxy.pl</code> .


	<a name="fastcgi" />
	<h3>As a FastCGI script</h3>

	<p><a href="http://www.fastcgi.com">FastCGI</a> scripts are similar to
	CGI scripts in some ways, but run faster than CGI scripts.  FastCGI can
	be used with most Web servers, including those that don't support CGI
	scripts, such as <a href="http://www.nginx.org">nginx</a>.  A FastCGI
	script runs as multiple managed processes on a server, and is called by
       	the Web	server process.

	<p>After installing CGIProxy, configure your Web server to use CGIProxy
	as a FastCGI script, using your settings of $SECRET_PATH and
	$FCGI_SOCKET; you can view these settings in either the configuration
	menu or the file <code>cgiproxy.conf</code> .   Examples of
	how to configure the nginx and Apache servers are just below.

	<p>To start the FastCGI process, run the command
	"<code>cgiproxy/bin/nph-proxy.cgi start-fcgi</code>" from your home directory.
	This runs the process in the <i>foreground</i>.  To run it in the background,
	add "<code>-q &amp;</code>" to the end of the command (the "<code>-q</code>"
	tells CGIProxy to be quiet, i.e. to not print messages to the console).

	<p>To stop the background FastCGI process in Unix, run the command
	"<code>killall nph-proxy.cgi</code>".


	<h4>Configuring nginx with FastCGI</h4>

	<p>Include a section like this in your <code>nginx.conf</code>, within
	the secure server section:
<blockquote><pre>
location /secret/ {
    fastcgi_pass             localhost:8002;
    fastcgi_split_path_info  ^(/secret)(/?.*)$;
    fastcgi_param            SCRIPT_NAME $fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param            PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    include                  fastcgi.conf;      # if not included elsewhere
}
</pre></blockquote>

	<p>The first three lines need to match your configuration in nph-proxy.cgi :
      	replace "<code>secret</code>" (in two places!) with your setting of $SECRET_PATH,
	and replace "<code>8002</code>" with your setting of $FCGI_SOCKET if you
	changed it from the default.


	<h4>Configuring Apache with FastCGI</h4>

	<p>Include a line like this in your <code>httpd.conf</code>:
<blockquote><pre>
FastCgiExternalServer /var/www/html/secret -host localhost:8002
</pre></blockquote>

	<p>Replace "<code>/var/www/html/secret</code>" with your setting of $SECRET_PATH
	appended to your DocumentRoot, and replace "<code>8002</code>" with your setting
	of $FCGI_SOCKET if you changed it from the default.


	<a name="embedded" />
	<h3>Using CGIProxy's embedded server</h3>

	<p>CGIProxy includes an embedded Web server, so you don't need an external
	Web server to run it.  However, you will need a <i>key pair</i>.  (All
	secure servers need this, but external servers usually have a key pair
	already installed by your hosting provider.)
	A key pair consists of a <i>certificate</i> (visible to the
	public) and a <i>private key</i> (which you must keep secret).
	You can get a key pair for your server from a <i>certificate authority</i> (CA).
	Most certificate authorities charge an annual fee for a key pair, but
	<a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a> provides them for free.
	They also provide the <a href="https://certbot.eff.org">Certbot</a> tool
	to automate the process of managing your certificate.
	After you install CGIProxy, you'll need to copy the certificate and
	private key files into the "<code>cgiproxy</code>" directory under your
	home directory.

	<p>After installing CGIProxy, start the embedded server by running the
	command "<code>cgiproxy/bin/nph-proxy.cgi start-server</code>" from your
	home directory.  After it starts, it
	will tell you the URL to access the proxy with (including the actual
	port number), and the process ID of the running server.

	<p>To stop the embedded server in Unix, run the command
	"<code>killall nph-proxy.cgi</code>".



	<hr>

	<a name="install" />
	<h2>Installing CGIProxy</h2>

	<p><b>As of version 2.2.3, the <code>.tar.gz</code> distribution file
	has a different structure than before, so there is one more step
	(described in step 3 below) to extract the <code>nph-proxy.cgi</code> file.
	Alternately, you can directly download the new script file as 
	<a href="nph-proxy.txt">nph-proxy.txt</a>, rename it to
	"<code>nph-proxy.cgi</code>", and skip step 3 below.</b>

	<p>Once the prerequisites are in place, then to install CGIProxy:
	<ol>
	    <li>Upload the distribution file (the file ending in "<code>.tar.gz</code>")
	    to your Web server.
	    <li>Log in to a <i>shell account</i> on the server.
	    <li>Unpack the distribution:  On Unix, run the commands:
		<ol>
		    <li><code>tar xzvf cgiproxy.*.tar.gz</code>
		    <li><code>tar xzvf cgiproxy-inner.*.tar.gz</code>
		</ol>
	    From that you have two files, <code>nph-proxy.cgi</code> and <code>README</code> .
	    <code>nph-proxy.cgi</code> is the program you'll be installing
	    and running.  That's it-- just one file.
	    <li>If you want to rename <code>nph-proxy.cgi</code> (see below),
	    do it now.
	    <li>Run the command "<code>./nph-proxy.cgi install</code>".  This does
	    almost everything required to install CGIProxy.  It runs a simple
	    installation wizard that asks you a few questions.  Ideally you can
	    run this as root, but it should work even if you don't have root
	    access.
	    <li><b>If using the embedded server:</b>  Copy both files of your key pair
	    (described in "Prerequisites" above) into the "<code>cgiproxy</code>"
	    directory under your home directory.
	    The filenames should match the configuration
	    variables $CERTIFICATE_FILE and $PRIVATE_KEY_FILE, which are
	    "plain-cert.pem" and "plain-key.pem" unless you changed them.
	    <li><b>If installing on a Windows server:</b>  Add a daily or hourly
	    task to purge the database in the Task Scheduler, using the command
	    "<code>perl \path\to\script\nph-proxy.cgi</code>" (replace with the correct path)
	    and the parameter "<code>purge-db</code>".  If you're allowing us to
	    collect simple usage statistics (i.e. if $REPORT_USAGE is true), add
	    two more tasks to the Task Scheduler:
	    <ol>
		<li>Every week or month, run "<code>perl \path\to\script\nph-proxy.cgi</code>"
		with the parameter "<code>report-usage</code>";
	        <li>At midnight at the beginning of every month, run the same command
		with the parameter "count-unique-users".
	    </ol>
	</ol>

	<p>As part of the wizard, you will see a simple menu that lets you modify
	any configuration variables in CGIProxy.  (You probably don't need to
	change anything.)  When you're finished, enter "0" to save your settings
	and exit the configuration menu.  After installing CGIProxy, you can
	always run the configuration menu again	by running
	"<code>./nph-proxy.cgi config</code>".

	<p>After the configuration, the wizard will install all the Perl CPAN
	modules needed by CGIProxy.  To <i>only</i> install these modules, and not do any
	other installation tasks, run "<code>./nph-proxy.cgi install-modules</code>".
	If running as root, and if the server uses any of the <code>dnf</code>,
	<code>yum</code>, or <code>apt-get</code> package managers, CGIProxy tries
	to use the system's package manager to install CPAN modules; otherwise, it
	uses the standard <code>cpan</code> utility to install them.

	<p>You can rename <code>nph-proxy.cgi</code> if you want.  However, if
	you're installing it as a CGI script or under mod_perl, be sure the name
	still starts with "<code>nph-</code>".  (You can change that requirement
	for mod_perl, by reconfiguring mod_perl.)



	<hr>

	<a name="upgrade" />
	<h2>Upgrading CGIProxy from a previous version</h2>

	<p>To upgrade CGIProxy <i>from</i> version 2.2.3 or later, simply run
	"<code>./nph-proxy.cgi upgrade</code>".  If you want to run this automatically,
	put it in a cron job that runs weekly or monthly.  This command only
	upgrades if there is a newer version of CGIProxy than what you are currently
	running.

	<p>To upgrade CGIProxy from version 2.2.2 or earlier, the easiest way is to
	uninstall CGIProxy and then install the new version, with these steps:
	<ol>
	    <li>First, get the new version of the script from
		<a href="nph-proxy.txt">nph-proxy.txt</a> and rename it to
		"<code>nph-proxy.cgi</code>".
	    <li>If you want to save your previous configuration settings, copy
		the file <code>cgiproxy/cgiproxy.conf</code> to somewhere
		<i>outside</i> of your $PROXY_DIR (which is usually "<code>cgiproxy/</code>"
		under your home directory).
	    <li>Run "<code>./nph-proxy.cgi uninstall</code>".
	    <li>Run "<code>./nph-proxy.cgi install</code>".  If you saved your
		old <code>cgiproxy.conf</code> in step 2, then run
		"<code>./nph-proxy.cgi install --old-config cgiproxy.conf</code>"
		instead.
	</ol>

	<p>When running the "<code>upgrade</code>" command, CGIProxy verifies the
	code signature of the inner <code>.tar.gz</code> file to ensure it's the
	same as the original <code>.tar.gz</code> file from
	<a href="https://jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/">jmarshall.com</a>.



	<hr>

	<a name="uninstall" />
	<h2>Uninstalling CGIProxy</h2>

	<p><b>*** NOTE:  If you're using version 2.2.3 and your $SECRET_PATH is empty,
	do NOT run the "uninstall" command, as it will delete the whole directory where
	nph-proxy.cgi is installed.  This is fixed in version 2.2.4 and later.  (Using
	an empty $SECRET_PATH is not recommended anyway.)</b>

	<p>To uninstall CGIProxy 2.2.3 or later, run "<code>./nph-proxy.cgi uninstall</code>".

	<p>To uninstall CGIProxy 2.2.2 or earlier, first get the new version of the
	script from <a href="nph-proxy.txt">nph-proxy.txt</a> and rename it to
	"<code>nph-proxy.cgi</code>".  Then, run this command with the new copy
	you just downloaded:  "<code>./nph-proxy.cgi uninstall</code>".  If it can't
	figure out exactly where the earlier version is installed, it will ask you
	for the complete path to the old <code>nph-proxy.cgi</code>.

	<p>Note that this does <i>not</i> remove all traces of CGIProxy-- here are
	traces that remain that you may want to delete:
	<ul>
	    <li>If you're using a database other than SQLite, the "cgiproxy" database
		will still be there, along with any special user created for CGIProxy.
	    <li>The installation wizard may have installed various Perl modules, either
		in the system location (if run as root), or under the "<code>perl5/</code>"
		directory under your home directory (if not run as root).
	    <li>You may have configured your web server in order to run CGIProxy.
	    <li>If you're using a Windows server, you will need to remove any
		related tasks from the Task Scheduler.
	</ul>



	<hr>

	<a name="after" />
	<h2>After you install</h2>

	<p>Please review the <a href="security.html">security guidelines</a> before doing
       	anything further.

	<p>If you want your proxy to be usable by other people, you need to communicate
	the proxy URL to them.  Try to use a secure method to do so, or else the proxy
	could easily be discovered by censors and blocked, or worse.

	<p><b>In particular, don't be tempted to post your proxy URL to any public
	sites that list available proxies.  If you do, the censors will quickly
	see your proxy and block it, or there may be even worse consequences.  These
	proxy-listing sites may be useful for anonymity, but for getting around
	censorship they	are dangerous!  They make the censors' job easier.</b>

	<p><b>In addition, people should only be using proxies installed by
	people or organizations that they trust.</b>

	<p>If heavy use of this proxy puts too much load on your server, see
	"NOTES ON PERFORMANCE" near the top of the source code.  The biggest
	improvement comes from running this under mod_perl or FastCGI.



	<hr>

	<a name="trouble" />
	<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

	<a name="ts-badrequest" />
	<h3>"Bad Request" errors</h3>

	<p>These happen when you accumulate too many cookies for the Web server
	to handle.  To fix it, use a database with CGIProxy.  The easiest database
	to use is SQLite-- to use it, just set $DB_DRIVER to "SQLite".  To use a
	running database engine like MariaDB/MySQL or Oracle, you must also create
	a database account for CGIProxy to use, and set $DB_USER and $DB_PASS.

	<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Whenever you use a database, it will accumulate old data
	that you need to purge periodically for both performance and security reasons.
	To purge the database, run
	"<code>./nph-proxy.cgi purge-db</code>" regularly.  On a Unix server, do
	this automatically with a <i>cron job</i> .  The CGIProxy installation
	wizard normally adds this cron job for you, but if it doesn't, then you
	can do it yourself:  run "<code>crontab -e</code>" to edit your list of
	cron jobs, and add a line like this to purge the database every morning
	at e.g. 2:13am:
	<blockquote><code>
	    13 2 * * * /path/to/script/nph-proxy.cgi purge-db
	</code></blockquote>
	<p>Replace "<code>/path/to/script/</code>" with the full path to <code>nph-proxy.cgi</code> .
	If you'd rather purge the database every hour, change the "2" above to "*".
	<p>If you ran "<code>./nph-proxy.cgi install</code>" as root, then do this as root
	too, but instead of running "<code>crontab -e</code>", run
	"<code>crontab -e -u $RUN_AS_USER</code>", where $RUN_AS_USER is that username from
	the CGIProxy configuration.  This modifies the list of cron jobs belonging
	to $RUN_AS_USER .
	<p>On a Windows server, use the Task Scheduler to do this instead of a cron job.
